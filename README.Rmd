# SocialMediaRetention

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`SocialMediaRetention` aims to compute the retention rates for two cohorts of users (for instance, YouTube commenters who interact with videos released at different periods). Here is an example: <https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/12882>

## Installation

You can install the development version of `SocialMediaRetention` like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("aidar-zinnatullin/SocialMediaRetention")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(SocialMediaRetention)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r treated}
load("data/retention_control.Rdata")
load("data/retention_treat.Rdata")
treated_ci_data <- compute_bootstrap_ci(retention_data_treated, n_bootstrap = 100, confidence_intervals = 0.95)
head(treated_ci_data, n = 5)
```

```{r control}
control_ci_data <- compute_bootstrap_ci(retention_data_control, n_bootstrap = 100, confidence_intervals = 0.95)
head(control_ci_data, n = 5)
```
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

The `visualize_retention` command generates a graph that displays Retention Rates Over Time. The plot showcases how the proportion of users retained varies across different retention periods (in months) and compares two groups: Control and Treated. This visualization uses lines with shaded areas to highlight the trends and differences in user retention between these groups over a specified timeframe. This tool is ideal for analyzing the long-term impact of interventions or treatments on user engagement.

```{r hhh, echo = FALSE}
load("data/progov_vis_yt_first_monday.RData")
```

```{r pressure, echo = TRUE}
plot <- visualize_retention(treated_data = progov_treated_yt_n, control_data = progov_control_yt_n)
plot
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
