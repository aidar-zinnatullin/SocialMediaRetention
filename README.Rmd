# SocialMediaRetention

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

SocialMediaRetention aims to compute the retention rates for two cohorts of users (for instance, YouTube commenters who interact with videos released at different periods). Here is an example: <https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/12882>

## Installation

You can install the development version of SocialMediaRetention like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("aidar-zinnatullin/SocialMediaRetention")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(SocialMediaRetention)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r treated}
load("data/retention_control.Rdata")
load("data/retention_treat.Rdata")
treated_ci_data <- compute_bootstrap_ci(retention_data_treated, n_bootstrap = 100, confidence_intervals = 0.95)
head(treated_ci_data, n = 5)
```

```{r control}
control_ci_data <- compute_bootstrap_ci(retention_data_control, n_bootstrap = 100, confidence_intervals = 0.95)
head(control_ci_data, n = 5)
```
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot <- visualize_retention(treated_ci_data, control_ci_data)
plot
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
